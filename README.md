# ANTHROPOLOGIE-Project

some information about ANTHROPOLOGIE 
Anthropologie was founded by current URBN chairman and president Dick Hayne, having heard the plea of a friend. She had just moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia,
and was dissatisfied with the shopping options available to her. Now a distance from Urban Outfitters—a brand she also was aging out of—there was a void in her life.
She longed for a store to indulgeher creative side. Dick, realizing this wasn't an isolated phenomenon, went on to build a lifestyle brand that catered to creative,
educated and affluent 30-45 year-old women. Named after his college major (but with a decidedly French twist), Anthropologie opened its very first doors in the autumn of
1992 in Wayne, Pennsylvania. We now operate over 200 stores worldwide.
